This repository contains materials produced during the practice
of the 7th semester at Saint-Petersburg State University (SPbU).

The work is devoted to the analysis of visual data related to guitar performance.
The repository includes experimental notebooks and Python code for detecting
guitar parts, reconstructing string geometry using analytical methods,
and extracting hand landmarks from images and video frames.

The results presented here serve as a basis for further development
within the bachelor thesis.
